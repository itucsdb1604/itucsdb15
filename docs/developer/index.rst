Database Design
---------------

In the process of implementing this website, IMDB was imitated. However, instead of movies, this project is a book database.
Our database cosists of some tables and relations such as book, writer, publisher, user, message etc.
Users table is in the center of our database, since users would be able to add new books or remove the existing ones. Moreover, they would be able to rate a spesific book or writer.
There is the Relation Diagram of our Book Database in the next page.
